Every action can have zero or more bindings. If an action has multiple bindings they will be combined according to the action type. If action has zero bindings the action is marked as `inactive` letting the application know that it will not be used. The application can use the `inactive` value to enable / disable features such as aim assist (if a *Delta2D* `Turn` action is bound) or quick time events (if a quick time event key is unbound).

[[Input Component Types|Input Components]] are bound to [[Input Action Types|Input Actions]] using *bindings*.  Bindings can be very simple, such as directly binding a [[Input Component Types#Button Boolean|Button]] component to a [[Input Action Types#Boolean|Boolean]] action. But they can also be complex, like binding a [[Input Component Types#Move2D Delta2D|Scroll Wheel]] to that same Boolean action or binding [[Input Component Types#Motion Combined Gyro Accel|Gyro Motion]] to [[Input Action Types|Delta2D]].
