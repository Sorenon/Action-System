Every action can have zero or more bindings. If action has zero bindings the action is marked as `inactive` letting the application know that it will not be used. If an action has multiple bindings they will be combined according to the action type.

[[Input Component Types|Input Components]] are bound to [[Input Action Types|Input Actions]] using *bindings*.  Bindings can be very simple, such as directly binding a [[Input Component Types#Button Boolean|Button]] component to a [[Input Action Types#Boolean|Boolean]] action. But they can also be complex, for example binding a [[Input Component Types#Move2D Delta2D|Scroll Wheel]] to that same Boolean action.
