Chords and ~~Shortcuts~~ Combos are very similar, typically both being called shortcuts instead of having unique names. 

## Chords
Chords are the more popular form. For example {CTRL+S} and {CTRL+ALT+DEL} are both chords. One or more modifier inputs (e.g. CTRL, ALT, SHIFT) must be held before one command input (e.g. S, DEL) is triggered. 

The modifier inputs must be buttons but the command input can be any type. By default, every modifier key must be held before the command key, but this behaviour can be configured.

These are also an applicable alternative to Steam Input's *Mode Shift* setting.

## Combos
Combos are more niche than chords and only support Button inputs / outputs making them similar to [[Button Activators]]. A combo requires each input being triggered at roughly the same time to activate.
