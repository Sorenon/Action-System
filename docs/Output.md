The output portion of SuInput is extremely WIP as the vast majority of work has been focused on creating a strong input abstraction.

Should output actions have explicit types like LED or Rumble Vibration, or should they have more generic types like boolean and float? (with the complex haptic stuff done in the binding similar to input) See: [Brilliant idea about haptic output should work](https://youtu.be/-XBjj69-uK0?t=909)

### LED
### HD Vibration
### Rumble Vibration
### Wheel Force Feedback
### Rich Status Data
For fancy RGB setups (e.g. [Artemis](https://github.com/Artemis-RGB/Artemis))
### Player Number
### Adaptive Trigger
### Speaker?
